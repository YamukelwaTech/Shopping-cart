# Shopping Cart Application - Capstone Project 🛒

## Project Overview

Hey there! Welcome to this exciting capstone project! We're diving into the creation of a simple shopping cart application. The idea is to build a user-friendly interface where users can effortlessly add and remove items, tweak quantities, and see the total cost. Let's break it down into manageable steps to make this journey smooth and enjoyable.

## Step 1: Set up the HTML Structure 🏗️

1. Create a brand new HTML file named `index.html`.
2. Lay down the basic HTML structure with the essentials for our shopping cart.
3. Give it a friendly heading to display the product's name.
4. Throw in an input field for users to punch in their desired quantity.
5. Don't forget a button to add the chosen quantity to the shopping cart! Add an "onclick" attribute to call a JavaScript function.
6. Create a div element to showcase the shopping cart’s contents and total cost.

## Step 2: Style the Page using CSS and Bootstrap 🎨

1. Craft a shiny new CSS file named `styles.css`.
2. Let's link the CSS file to the HTML for that extra flair.
3. Bring in Bootstrap! We're doing that by linking to Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files.
4. Sprinkle some CSS magic and Bootstrap components to make the page visually appealing. Play with colors, fonts, and layout until it's easy on the eyes.

## Step 3: Add JavaScript Functionality 🚀

1. Time to get that JavaScript game strong! Create a new file named `scripts.js`.
2. Connect the JavaScript file to the HTML file.
3. Write a function to handle adding items to the shopping cart – make sure it:
   - Grabs the quantity entered by the user.
   - Updates the shopping cart with the new quantity.
   - Calculates the total cost based on the quantity and the product’s price.
4. Write another function for removing items from the shopping cart – this one:
   - Clears the shopping cart.
   - Resets the total cost to zero.
5. Craft a function to update the displayed shopping cart contents and total cost in the HTML.

## Step 4: Connect Functions to HTML Elements 🤝

1. Head back to the HTML file, add the “onclick” attribute to the ‘Add to Cart’ button and the input field.
2. Set the value of the “onclick” attribute to the appropriate functions (add items, remove items, update displayed content).

## Step 5: Test the Application 🧪

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser and start playing around! Test the shopping cart functionality.
2. Add and remove items, tweak quantities, and make sure the total cost is updating as expected.

## Step 6: Debug and Refine the Code 🛠️

1. It's time to put on our detective hats. Spot any issues, bugs, or inconsistencies? Fix them!
2. Polish up the code to ensure the application works like a charm.
